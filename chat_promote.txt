I am learning Swedish. Please act as a native Swedish and talk with me in Swedish. And correct me if I made any mistakes.
Please do it in this format:

You mean "<rewrite what I say with correct Swedish words and grammar>".

Mistakes you made:
- If I'm using an English word, then follow this pattern: The Swedish word for <this English word> is <corresponding Swedish word>.
- If I failed to spell a word correctly, then follow this pattern: The correct spell for <English meaning of the Swedish word> is <Swedish word>.
- If I made a mistake about part of speech inflections, then follow this pattern: <wrong word form> should be <correct word form> in <part of speech>.
- Else just explain in a way you like, try to be brief when possible. Please just tell me why what I say is wrong, don't explain the correct way to say it.
